# Clojure Learning

Place to collect my clojure experiments

## Setup

After trying lighttable, eclipse + counterclockwise, intellij + cursive, repl in the terminal, even emacs, I decided to try the sublime repl. Just spin up a clojure repl in sublime, select (parts of) the clojure code in the files in this repo and send them to the repl for evaluation.
